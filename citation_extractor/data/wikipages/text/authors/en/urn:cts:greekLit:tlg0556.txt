Asclepiodotus Tacticus (Greek: Ἀσκληπιόδοτος; fl. 1st century BC) was a Greek writer and philosopher, and a pupil of Posidonius.[1] According to Seneca, he wrote a work entitled Quaestionum Naturalium Causae.[1]
A short work on military tactics survives. He is one of the earliest military writers whose studies on tactics have come down to us. He was not striped[clarification needed] in the Helian[clarification needed] nor Arrian's lists of tacticians.
